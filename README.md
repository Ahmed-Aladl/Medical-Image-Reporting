# On the Automatic Generation of Medical Imaging Reports.
CheXNet is a powerful vision-language pre-training model capable of handling image-captioning tasks efficiently. This project utilizes the MIMIC-CXR Dataset for generating captions from Radiology X-ray images, specifically applying CheXNet with the Transformer decoder.

# FEATURES
. Object Detection : CheXNet, a DenseNet121-based architecture trained on large chest X-ray images, is used as the feature extractor for accurately identifying and localizing objects within images. Composed of multiple convolutional layers, CheXNet is capable of extracting intricate features from radiology images, ensuring reliable and efficient performance for medical image analysis. This model provides robust classification results, making it suitable for real-time applications in medical imaging.
